AJC possible bug with static nested classes
AJC fails to find nested static classes during binary-weaving analysis if the classes have been previously compiled with J2SE5.0 javac compiler with options: -source 1.5/ - target 1.5 Note, that the nested static classes are not necessarily subject to bytecode weaving - AJC merely fails to detect them in the JARS for its analysis. This issue disappears when the .java sources are pre-compiled with - source/target 1.4, regardless if the javac compiler comes from the J2SE1.4 or J2SE5.0 distribution. This issue is distinct form Bug #71548, since no 5.0 source code processing is required from AJC ever. Thanks, Hristo
