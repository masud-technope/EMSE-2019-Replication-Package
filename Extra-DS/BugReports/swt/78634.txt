ImageData.getTransparencyMask - incorrect javadoc or implementation wrong
The implementation of getTransparencyMask appears to return a fully opaque mask when the image has no transparency. The javadoc seems to infer that it would return null in that case. /** * Returns an &lt;code&gt;ImageData&lt;/code&gt; which specifies the * transparency mask information for the receiver, or null if the * receiver has no transparency and is not an icon. * * &#64;return the transparency mask or null if none exists */ public ImageData getTransparencyMask() (see implementation of ImageData.colorMask) On a different note, should we return a transparent mask based on the the alphaData values with the 127 threshold?
