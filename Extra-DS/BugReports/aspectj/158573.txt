changing value of variable in aspect results in adviceDidNotMatch warning
Given the following: public aspect A { public static int i = 0; before() : execution(* *.*(..)) {} } public class C { public void m() {} } Changing the value of i to be something else and then saving results in an incremental build and an "adviceDidNotMatch" warning. A full build clears the warning. This is since the JDTLikeHandleProvider (bug 141730) was made the default in AJDT and is down to the call on line 90 of CrosscuttingMembersSet which is the fix for bug 134541). The reason we now hit this is that the JDTLikeHandleProvider doesn't depend on location.
