Support -Xreweavable option
Adding a RFE as Wes suggested... Wes' reply: There are some issues with the -Xnoweave option that we won't have the time to carefully resolve for 1.1, even though, as you suggest, there may be times when it would be useful. The workaround at present is to weave tracing into transactions when the transactions jar is compiled. e.g., -- do the build ajc @tracing.lst -outjar tracing.jar ajc @transactions.lst -aspectpath tracing.jar \ -outjar transactions.jar ajc @app.lst -aspectpath "tracing.jar;transactions.jar" \ -outjar app.jar -- build the jar mkdir final cd final jar xf ../tracing.jar jar xf ../transactions.jar jar xf ../app.jar # fixup manifest, etc? jar cf ../final.jar * What if you don't have the sources for the transactions.jar? This is a case of getting binary transactions aspects from a vendor who won't provide source and wanting to weave your tracing into it. I would hope that by the time that problem becomes prevalent, we will have a solution for it. If you'd like to keep this on the radar, please submit this discussion as an RFE for the compiler at http://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=AspectJ Thank you - Wes P.S. - Personally, I think this case > > ajc -injars app.jar;transaction.jar > -aspectpath transaction.jar;tracing.jar doesn't make sense. Things on the aspectpath are defined, whereas things in injars will be woven into and redefined. It's not clear from this command which variant the user expects when refering to a type in transactions.jar.
