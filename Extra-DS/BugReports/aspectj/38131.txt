ajc needs -d . option while correctly compiling classes from subpackage
I am using 1.1rc1. This is a regression since rc1 and a deviation from javac. I am guessing this may have to do something with change in the underlying Eclipse compiler. Create a class in a subpackage such as: package subpackage; public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println("Hello"); } } Then compile using following command: > ajc subpackage\Test.java You will see a directory "subpackage" created under the existing "subpackage" directory. The test.class is then put in subpackage\subpackage directory. This means running java command results in Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: subpackage/Test Running either of the following command fixes the problem: > ajc -d . subpackage\Test.java or > javac subpackage\Test.java No big deal, really. But it will be nice to have same behavior as javac.
