"spurious ""circular dependency"" error"
AspectJ Compiler 1.1beta4 This program: aspect Foo { pointcut p1(): execution(void f()) && cflow(execution(void f1())); pointcut p2(): execution(void f()) && cflow(execution(void f2())); before(): p1() { } after(): p1() { } before(): p2() { } after(): p2() { } } class A { void f1() { f(); } void f2() { f(); } void f() { } } results in these errors: circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f()) circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f()) circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f()) circular dependency at method-execution(void A.f()) 4 errors If I comment out any one of the four pieces of advice, all the errors go away. Also, assuming that there is a valid reason for printing this error sometimes, how come there's no line number? --Doug
