fail in compiling aspect with overriding method introduction with different throws clause
A first class (class A) declares only one method with some exceptions in the throws clause ( void m() throws Exception ). A second class (class B) extends it without redefinig the method. An aspect declares a method introduction in the class B, with the same name, signature and return type of the one in class A, but without throws clause; this is a legal override. In the second class (class B) each invocation to the overriden method doesn't need a try-catch block, because it refers to his hown method that raises no exception.
