LTW Within Patterns Should Accept AND For Consistency
The load-time weaving definition system accepts AND in addition to &amp;&amp; for pointcuts, but it silently accepts and then fails to work with type patterns that use AND. Such type patterns are important when creating exceptions (e.g., excluding weblogic..* &amp;&amp; !weblogic.jdbc..*) and using AND is also helpful here. I've attached a patch to support this and tests to show it's working.
