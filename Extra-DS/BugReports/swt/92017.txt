Support very large Image on Windows platform
Currently an Image on Windows is size-limited - on my system to 16MB. However, a posting in eclipse.platform.swt in response to &quot;Larger image problems&quot; suggested that there is a way to get OS.CreateCompatibleBitmap to transparently return a DIB that is stored in main memory and can be any size. If there is a way to easily support this, it'd be really helpful.
