Load Time Weaving aborts on any kind of warning (declare/xlint)
The message handler in the weaving adapter for load time weaving says: public boolean handleMessage(IMessage message) throws AbortException { if (!isIgnoring(message.getKind())) { if (verbose) System.err.println(message.getMessage()); throw new AbortException(message); } return true; } This means for warnings it goes bang. So, even a declare warning that is meant to tell the user something informational during a LTW will cause the code to blow up. The fix is straightforward and simply to log warning messages and only fail for error messages. I am waiting for a testcase from Matthew before checking in the fix.
