swt.FileDialog: additional clarification in javadoc and convenience method
I was recently working out an issue with some code using the SWT FileDialog class. The soon-to-be-attached patch adds some additional information to the javadoc which explains some details I gleaned from reading the source but wasn't quite clear from the existing javadocs. The patch also adds a new method for setting the filter names and extensions which I believe is more convenient to use. I created the patch against the GTK version of SWT. It will need to be adapted for the other versions. (note: by &quot;adapt&quot; I merely mean that the line numbers need to be adjusted, none of the code is platform-specific)
