Annotation matching using within() PCD doesn't appear to be working.
From discussion on aspectj list: Hi, Well, having just done some testing, I think this even simpler case shows within() is not behaving correctly for annotations: @Entity public class myClass1 {...} public class myClass2 {...} public aspect myAspect { before():call(* *(..)) && within(@Entity *) { } } The pointcut matches all the method calls in myClass1 and myClass2 (effectively it is parsing but then ignoring the annotation specified in the within()). So, what you want to do is valid but AspectJ is misbehaving - you get a stack overflow because the perthis() clause is also matching on your aspect type when obviously that doesnt have the annotation and shouldnt be matched.

Exemple : Create an aspect instance for all object like that : @Entity public class myClass { ... } I try public aspect myAspect perthis(within(@Entity *)) {...} but this aspect execution lead to a java.lang.StackOverflowError exception. Is it possible ? Thanks. Micka?l _______________________________________________ aspectj-users mailing list aspectj-users@eclipse.org http://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/aspectj-users
