AspectJ 5 M2 should implement backwards compatibility for binary aspect form
Hi Adrian, thanks for the detailed explanation of the compatibility questions. That explains the problem I observed. > * An AspectJ program should always be run with the aspectjrt.jar runtime > library that accompanies the distribution containing the compiler/weaver > used to build it. Interesting point. Which one? The one that is used to compile it or the one that is used to weave it? > However, instead of some IOException, what you should see is a nice > message saying that the aspect was produced by a more recent version of > AspectJ and cannot be read.

Okay. Is there a bug to track this? I really would like to update the weaver of my weaving runtime but only if it allows to load/weave asepects that are compiled with any of the AJDT versions that are out right now (AJDT 1.1.x and AJDT 1.2.0Mx).
