Optimize shouldWeaveAnnotationStyleAspect with Patch
The current implementation of shouldWeaveAnnotationStyleAspect is surprising because it weaves annotation aspects without regard as to whether they are registered in an aop.xml file. If an annotation-style aspect is loaded, it is always woven, even if it doesn't match the for what classes should be woven in the aop.xml file, and even if not registered therein. This is both unexpected and it imposes significant overhead on configurations where they aren't used and simple fast match exclusions prevent weaving (see bug #152871). Is there really a need to weave annotation style aspects like this? Why can't it be done by using the aop.xml configuration mechanism that all other aspects use? In a large system, the CPU overhead of parsing and creating BCEL objects for all loaded classes should be avoided where possible.
