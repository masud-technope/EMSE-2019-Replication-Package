"retitle warning to ""circular {advice} dependency at ..."""
When writing aspects with cycles in the advice precedence, get warning "circular dependency at {join point}" -- should be "circular advice dependency..." or "circular advice precedences at {join point} -- reorder the advice in the aspect". FWIW, here's an example of circularity in advice precedence: ---- aspect A { pointcut crun() : execution (void run()) ; before() : crun() {} after() returning : crun() {} void around() : crun() { proceed(); } } ---- See programming guide for more discussion of circularity in advice precedence.
