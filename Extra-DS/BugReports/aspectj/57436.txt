Java 1.5 fails to run classes produced by ajc
Java 1.5 beta reports a ClassFormatError when running programs (e.g., spacewar) compiled by ajc 1.1.1 and the latest CVS head. Sun's Java 1.5 beta binary-compatibility docs say that some obfuscators violated the .class format specification, so those .class files will fail when run under 1.5. (The docs also say they are still incomplete.) Although 1.5 is still beta, we would want to submit a bug to Sun if our implementation techniques are valid, so we don't have to change those techniques. For 1.2, we should at document if we don't fix, since many people are using 1.5.
