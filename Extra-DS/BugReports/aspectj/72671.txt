Bootclasspath specification for compiling is not possible
I have following bug running eclipse 3.0 and ajdt 1.1.12 I have following class: import java.io.FileNotFoundException; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import org.w3c.dom.DOMConfiguration; import org.w3c.dom.DOMError; import org.w3c.dom.DOMErrorHandler; import org.w3c.dom.Document; import org.w3c.dom.DocumentFragment; import org.w3c.dom.NodeList; import org.w3c.dom.ls.DOMImplementationLS; import org.w3c.dom.ls.LSInput; import org.w3c.dom.ls.LSOutput; import org.w3c.dom.ls.LSParser; import com.dcbank.common.DOMImplementationLSSingleton; public class DOMHelper { public static final String CLASS_ID = "%full_filespec: DOMHelper.java~1:java:1 %"; public static void save(Document document, String filename) throws ClassNotFoundException, InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, FileNotFoundException { document.normalizeDocument(); } } which compiles very fine with JDK 1.4.2_02 on Windows XP, as soon as the dom2-xml-apis.jar and dom3-xercesImpl.jar are added at the beginning of the jre container, or are included in the jar-library list before the system jar. As soon as I convert this project to an AspectJ project, the code does not compile anymore. The aspectJ compiler does not find the normalizeDocument, which is included in the one of the two additional jars. method any more. kind regards Arno Schmidmeier
