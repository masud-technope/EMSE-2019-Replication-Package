Incorrect warning when advising a private method of a private inner class
The Eclipse AJDT give an incorrect warning when you want to advise a private method of a private inner class. When I want to advise a private method in a private inner class, like this public class Outer { private class Inner { private void myMethod() } } Using the following poincut: poincut innerpointcut():execution( * Outer.Inner.myMethod() ); and advice: before():innerpointcut() { System.out.println( "executing!" ); } I get a warning "invalidAbsoluteTypeName" next to my pointcut, but next to the advice, there is a marker that points to the private method.
