AspectJ does not correctly support -cp
Discovered by Andy Brodie. -cp is a shorthand for -classpath supported by the JDT compiler. AspectJ does not correctly support -cp option. Look at this example: C:\aspectj1.2>ajc -inpath injar.jar -outjar outjar.jar -cp lib\aspectjrt.jar [error] can't find type org.aspectj.lang.JoinPoint 1 error C:\aspectj1.2>ajc -inpath injar.jar -outjar outjar.jar -classpath lib\aspectjrt.jar This is due to the arg parser in AspectJ only recognizing -classpath. It doesn't fail when it encounters -cp, it just ignores it and passes it down to JDT for processing. The fix is to recognize -cp too.
