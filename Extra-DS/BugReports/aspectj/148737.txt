IllegalStateException for non-generic type
I believe this is similar to 112880. The message and stack trace I am getting are -- (IllegalStateException) Can't ask to parameterize a member of non-generic type: com...object kind(raw) Can't ask to parameterize a member of non-generic type: com...object kind(raw) java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't ask to parameterize a member of non-generic type: com....object kind(raw) at org.aspectj.weaver.ResolvedMemberImpl.parameterizedWith(ResolvedMemberImpl.java:612) at org.aspectj.weaver.ResolvedMemberImpl.parameterizedWith(ResolvedMemberImpl.java:597) at org.aspectj.weaver.ReferenceType.getDeclaredMethods(ReferenceType.java:508) at org.aspectj.weaver.ResolvedType$4.get(ResolvedType.java:225) at org.aspectj.weaver.Iterators$3$1.hasNext(Iterators.java:118) at org.aspectj.weaver.Iterators$5.hasNext(Iterators.java:171) at org.aspectj.weaver.Iterators$3.hasNext(Iterators.java:128) at org.aspectj.weaver.ResolvedType.lookupMember(ResolvedType.java:345) at org.aspectj.weaver.ResolvedType.lookupMethod(ResolvedType.java:326) . . . The same code was able to be weaved under 1.5.0. The reason why this is a major issue is 1.5.0 suffers from a StackOverflowException.
