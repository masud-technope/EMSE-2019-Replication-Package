Javadoc can not refer to package protected methods
In the javadoc for Widget.destroyWidget, we refer to package protected methods. These must be removed. We can just put them in the comments or remove them entirely. The following build errors are caused by this problem: /builds/I200508161235/src/plugins/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/../org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT/win32/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Widget.java:333: warning - Tag &#64;see: can't find releaseChild in org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget /builds/I200508161235/src/plugins/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/../org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT/win32/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Widget.java:333: warning - Tag &#64;see: can't find releaseWidget in org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget /builds/I200508161235/src/plugins/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/../org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse SWT/win32/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Widget.java:333: warning - Tag &#64;see: can't find releaseHandle in org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget
