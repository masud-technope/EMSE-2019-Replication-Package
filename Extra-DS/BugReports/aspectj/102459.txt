provide more detail in -showWeaveInfo messages
When advice is executed, the object you have to work with is the joinpoint. This can then be queried to get various information out of it. It would be nice, if as part of the weaving you could get hold of the same information. This is particularly useful in the case of writing a coverage tool. In order to measure where you've been, you have to know all the places you could possibly go. The introduction of the -showWeaveInfo option means that we can record these places, however, this would be greatly enhanced by providing similar information as to that which is collected as the program is running. The information which would be good is the same as that obtained from JoinPoint.StaticPart.getSignature().toLongString().
