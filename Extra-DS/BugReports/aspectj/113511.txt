LTW enhancements
Alex, here is the basic patch that is working well before you leave for the weekend ;-) I'll let Matthew post it officially to bugzilla since it was his idea. The earlier return from !enabled is a small addition I made that seems to help further. It would be great to have this in HEAD so I can report performance numbers based on it in part 2 of my article on developerworks ;-) Hope you are enjoying your new addition! Thanks!
