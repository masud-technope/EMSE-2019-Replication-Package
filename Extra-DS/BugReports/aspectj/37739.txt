Unexpected Xlint:unresolvableMember warning with withincode
The following code produces an Xlint:unresolvableMember warning: class A { A(Class type) {} A() { this(String.class); } } class B { public void test() { } public void test2() { test(); } } aspect C { void around() : (call (void B.test()) && withincode (void B.test2())) { proceed(); } } The warning text is: Warning.java:22 can not resolve this member: void A.<catch>(java.lang.ClassNotFoundException) [Xlint:unresolvableMember] Line 22 is the line in the aspect that says "withincode". If I comment out the aspect, the warning goes away. Also, if I comment out A's default constructor, it goes away. The "String.class" seems to have something to do with the warning. I can reproduce this with 1.1rc1 and 1.1rc2.
